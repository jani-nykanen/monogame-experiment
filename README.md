**"The Faceless Mountain is a short rage-game where you climb a slippery mountain. Use your face (!) as a grappling hook to reach places where your poor jumping skills would never get you. Avoid enemies and spike traps. They cannot kill you, but they will knock you back, and of course you don't want to drown in the black ocean!"**
